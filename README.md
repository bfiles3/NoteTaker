This app was created to allow users to input and save data as notes. Within the app, the user also has the ability to look over previous notes, as well as delete past notes. 

To start writing the code, I began by linking the dependencies and any HTML files I would need in order to display the page. I set the variable for the PORT. After, I created two empty arrays. The arrays were for the list of notes, and then for each individual note.

Following the creation of all my variables and arrays, I started to get to work on the actual functionality of the app. In order to do that, I had to create a function which took in the user's note, and then gave that note an ID. That ID was then appended to the notes variable. I used if / else statements for this piece of code.

For the last piece of the code, I created a function that would give the user the ability to delete notes if they so chose. I essentially used much of the same code from the note creation, to create the function to delete. I then coded a server listener, pushed to GitHub and then deployed to Heroku!
